## Project Overview  

> WiZ Matter Integration — Global Smart Home Protocol Adoption

Led the adoption of Matter, a new smart home protocol, across WiZ’s ecosystem of over one million devices. The initiative aimed to launch Matter-enabled products within a one-year timeline, aligned with the official protocol release. With no prior team experience in Matter, I developed a comprehensive strategy leveraging internal and external resources to ensure successful integration and certification.
