## Project Overview

> Driving Global Matter Protocol Integration

As the Product Owner for WiZ Integration and Platform, I spearheaded the ambitious initiative to adopt Matter, a nascent smart home protocol, across our ecosystem of over a million existing and newly manufactured devices. 

The primary objective was to launch our Matter-enabled products within a challenging one-year timeframe, aligning precisely with the official Matter protocol release schedule. This undertaking was particularly complex as our team lacked prior experience with Matter, necessitating a comprehensive strategy to leverage all available internal and external resources.

## Team & My Role
This cross-functional endeavor involved a dedicated platform value stream team, complemented by extensive collaboration across internal departments and external partners.

**Platform Value Stream Team:**

- Product Manager: 1 (Myself)
- System Architects: 2
- Engineers: ~10 (Total)
    - Firmware Engineers: 6-7
    - App Engineer: 1
    - Cloud Engineers: 2
    - Hardware Validation Engineers: 2-3
- On-demand UI/UX Designer

**Cross-functional & External Collaboration:** Beyond our core team, I collaborated extensively with Global Product Manager (GPM), Quality Assurance, Legal, and numerous other internal teams. Crucially, this project also involved navigating complex partnerships with major external players like Google, Amazon Alexa, SmartThings, Apple, and Home Assistant, ensuring a seamless end-to-end flow from factory production to over-the-air (OTA) updates for in-field WiZ products.

## Challenges
Integrating Matter presented a multifaceted array of technical, operational, and strategic challenges:

- **Mastering Nascent Specification**: Gaining a thorough understanding of the extensive and still-evolving Matter specification (thousands of pages) with no prior team experience.
- **End-to-End Production & OTA Integration**: Ensuring smooth production and over-the-air (OTA) updates for millions of WiZ devices, from factory rollout to in-field product updates, requiring deep coordination with both internal and external partners.
- **System Integration & User Experience Alignment**: Integrating the WiZ and Matter ecosystems onto a single chip while meticulously aligning the user flows to maintain a consistent and intuitive user experience.
- **Aggressive Timeline**: Releasing full Matter functionality within an extremely tight one-year timeline, directly tied to the official Matter protocol release, demanding rapid decision-making and execution.

## Software Development Life Cycle
I led the team through an iterative and highly collaborative SDLC, adapted for the unique challenges of integrating a new, evolving protocol.

### Initiation

- **Protocol Deep Dive**: Personally undertook an exhaustive review of the almost thousand-page Matter specification to gain foundational knowledge.
- **Internal Kick-off**: Initiated cross-functional working groups to assess Matter's impact on our existing architecture and identify key areas of change.

### Planning

- **End-to-End Flow Definition**: Defined comprehensive end-to-end flows, spanning from device manufacturing, through software development, to third-party platform adoption and final certification.
- **Security & Hardware NPI Adjustment**: Drove critical discussions and pushed for necessary adjustments in our security protocols and New Product Introduction (NPI) hardware flows to accommodate Matter's requirements.
- **Roadmap & Resource Allocation**: Collaborated with system architects and engineering leads to define the detailed Matter integration roadmap and allocated resources effectively within the tight timeline.

### Development & Testing (Iterative & Collaborative)

- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Fostered a continuous feedback loop between engineering teams, ensuring rapid iteration on firmware, app, and cloud components.
- **Interoperability Focus**: Emphasized rigorous testing for interoperability with various Matter controllers (e.g., Google Nest Hub, Apple HomePod mini) from early development stages.
- **Cross-Functional Sprints**: Coordinated development sprints across firmware, app, and cloud teams, addressing integration complexities as they emerged.
- **Implemented SAFe Scrum methodology***

### Release & Deployment

- **Certification Process Management**: Managed the complex Matter certification process, working directly with the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) and external partners.
- **Phased Rollout Strategy**: Defined the strategy for rolling out Matter support to existing and new devices, leveraging our robust OTA infrastructure. Also, I provided several Matter workshops to internal and external groups.

### Metric Review & Iteration

- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored key performance indicators post-launch, including device connectivity, responsiveness, and user adoption rates for Matter-enabled features.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Established channels for ongoing feedback from partners and users to inform future iterations and expand Matter functionalities.


## Achievements

- **Global Leadership in Matter Certification (2024)**: Under my leadership, our team was recognized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as having achieved the highest number of Matter certifications worldwide in 2024, a testament to our technical execution and strategic vision.

- **Pioneering Amazon Partnership Program**: Initiated and led WiZ’s 2024 FFS/Matter-based Amazon partnership program—marking our business unit's first strategic, technology-driven collaboration of this magnitude. 

- **Successful New Protocol Adoption**: Successfully guided the integration of a complex, evolving protocol (Matter) across a diverse product portfolio, demonstrating strong technical leadership and program management capabilities in a challenging environment.

- **Enhanced Interoperability & User Experience**: Delivered significantly enhanced interoperability for WiZ products within the broader smart home ecosystem, directly improving the end-user experience and expanding market reach.
