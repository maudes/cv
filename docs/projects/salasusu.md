## Project Overview

This initiative was a ground-up effort launched by the team with the goal of expanding the reach of a social enterprise. I was invited to join as a volunteer, contributing to the planning and execution of a new e-commerce platform designed to accelerate growth, promote sustainable impact, and connect the organization with a broader audience.

## Team Size

- Marketing manager: 1
- Product owner/ UX: 1 (*me)
- Fullstack engineer: 1
- Outsourced UIUX design team: 1

## Challenges

- This project was built entirely from scratch, with no prior experience in integrating any Japanese e-commerce services.
- How can we strike a balance between commercial goals and NGO-driven impact?
- What strategies can we adopt to reach a wider audience and effectively promote sales?

## Solutions

- 

## Highlights

- We successfully launched the new e-commerce platform on schedule and received positive feedback from users and partners.
