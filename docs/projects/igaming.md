## Project Overview

> Launching a Self-Hosted SaaS for White Label Clients

Following the successful launch of a new Sports Betting App, my team embarked on an ambitious initiative: to develop and release a **self-hosted lottery platform as a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution** designed for private label (white label) clients. The comprehensive scope of this project encompassed delivering a full product suite, ranging from robust user-facing web applications to powerful administrative dashboards, enabling clients to quickly deploy their own branded lottery operations.

## Team & My Role

This complex undertaking involved a dedicated cross-functional development team. I served as a Product Manager, playing a pivotal role in shaping the product vision and driving its execution.

- Product Managers: 2 (including myself)
- System Architects: 1
- Engineers: 6 (Total)
    - Front-end Engineers: 3
    - Back-end Engineers: 3
- UI/UX Designers: 2

As a Product Manager, my role spanned the entire product lifecycle, from initial strategy and discovery to delivery and continuous optimization. I was directly responsible for driving the product development and management for this iGaming SaaS platform.

## Challenges
Launching a self-hosted iGaming lottery SaaS platform presented unique and significant challenges:

- **Comprehensive Feature Set for White Label**: Developing a versatile product kit, from user-facing applications to a robust admin dashboard, that could be easily customized and deployed by various white-label clients, catering to their diverse operational needs.
- **Aggressive Market Entry Timeline**: Delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent features within tight deadlines to capture market share in a competitive landscape.

## Tech Stacks & My Contribution
The platform was built using a modern and scalable tech stack to support its complex functionalities and high-performance requirements.

- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js
- **Backend Language**: PHP
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Methodology**: Agile development (Scrum, Kanban)

### My Key Contributions:

- **End-to-End Product Leadership**: Led the complete end-to-end product planning, development, and testing for the SaaS platform. This included overseeing critical components such as payment flow development, building robust data analytics dashboards, and managing chat room functionalities, alongside vendor selection and platform integration.
- **Agile Development & Delivery**: Managed the agile development process (utilizing Scrum framework elements like planning, daily stand-ups, and PoC demos) to ensure efficient delivery of the MVP SaaS product, achieving a 15% increase in client operational efficiency.
- **Quality Assurance & Optimization**: Organized and implemented regular performance assessments and comprehensive test plans to refine the scalability, reliability, and stability of products, directly aligning with operational needs and business goals.
- **Bug Resolution & Stability**: Utilized Kanban for efficient bug resolution, ensuring product stability and supporting key stakeholders.

## Software Development Life Cycle
I managed the team through an agile and iterative SDLC, adapting methodologies to fit the rapid development and dynamic requirements of the iGaming industry.

### Initiation
- **Scope Definition**: Defined the initial MVP scope for the self-hosted SaaS platform, outlining core features for both user-facing and admin panels, including initial requirements for data dashboards and chat functionalities.
