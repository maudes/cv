## Project Overview  

> CarePilot — Personal Health Tracker & Backend Sandbox

In 2025, I earned my Emergency Medical Technician (EMT-1) certification in Taiwan. On the frontline, I witnessed first-hand how fragmented health information can hinder critical care. This experience sparked my interest in MedTech, leading me to join the OHDSI community and compete in the Civic Tech Taiwan competition (MODA × Taoyuan City Gov't; 2025), where my team was honored as a Finalist.

> "Bridging the gap between the ambulance frontline and personal health data standards."

While the competition exposed the systemic obstacles in medical data exchange, it also inspired me to tackle the problem from the individual's perspective. I developed CarePilot — a personal health tracking dashboard — as a functional extension of these insights.

CarePilot is more than just a tracking app; it is a **technical sandbox** where I explore the intersection of backend architecture and the **HL7 FHIR** standard. As the sole developer and PM, I focused on building a system that doesn't just record numbers, but structures them for future medical interoperability.

## Role & Scope  
I led the full lifecycle from architecture to deployment, validating backend patterns and FHIR interoperability.

My core strategy was a "Local-first" philosophy. By building a self-hosted, lightweight dashboard similar to Home Assistant, CarePilot prioritizes Data Sovereignty. This addresses the market gap between convenient tracking and absolute data privacy, ensuring sensitive metrics remain under the user's direct control.

## Key Challenges & Solutions  

- **Health Data Modeling & Interoperability**：Designed a scalable FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and Pydantic schema validation, with planned support for FHIR conversion  
- **Authentication & Security**：Implemented JWT and OTP-based authentication with multi-environment support, Redis-backed session management for secure access  
- **Scalability & Maintainability**：Built a modular backend architecture with Alembic migrations and Dockerized environments for long-term extensibility  
- **Testing & Reliability**：Used pytest for unit testing and validation of core modules
